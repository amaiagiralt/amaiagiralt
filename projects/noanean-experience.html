        We believe that traveling is one of the best ways to learn, for that reason we created Noanean Experiences, to offer “learning by doing experiences” in the Basque Country. We offered a proactive learning experience with the most innovative sectors in Euskadi (Gastronomy, education and cooperativism. To make this happen we had local support and we used radically different methodologies so that our clients could co-create during the experience with companies, discover gastronomy innovations and see new education systems (Amara Berri System and Mondragon Team Academy).
