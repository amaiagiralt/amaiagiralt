        It was summer, me and my colleagues were  all from San Sebastian...we knew every place in the city we knew where to have fun, where you should go to eat, we knew  also what you need to live to remember the experience and we knew that  lots of foreigners come to San Sebastian  to practice Spanish. For that reason we created different cultural activities to show the city and help them improve their spanish. For this purpose we collaborate with different language schools.
