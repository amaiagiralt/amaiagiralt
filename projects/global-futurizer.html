      <h3>What's GLOBAL FUTURIZER?</h3>
      <p>
        It is an event where young talents and companies come together through a user centered design thinking process to build the solutions for the future. Taking into account the wide gap that exist among universities and companies, Global Futurizer comes along as a tool for closing the gap.
      </p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>
        Being positioned as a company that innovates in its products and services, is not only a flashion trend, it so lead the market towards the future. Society evolutes really fast, so the ability of creating new products and services that will suit the market of the future is the only way to become a leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        This companies and new competences need talents who know how to guide the processes of service design and how to lead entrepreneurial teams. That is why they need to be in touch with universities, where this new talent comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be the second edition of Global Futuraizer Shangai. The first one was in 2012 made by: taZEBAez, the creators of the concept.
