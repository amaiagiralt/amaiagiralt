        We created a startup that organized gastronomic and cultural experiences (events, activities, guerrilla marketing actions) as an innovative way to deal with customer attraction, business differentiation and customer experience. The project was born in September 2012, starting its activity in the Basque Country. In addition, we had developed few projects in Asia. Our fundamental principle has always been to adapt to our clients.For that reason, we created cultural and gastronomic customized concepts to supply each of their needs.
